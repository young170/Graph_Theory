## Introduction
This note consists of fundamental definitions of graph theory

## What is a graph?
Let $G = (V, E, R)$ where:
- $V$ is the set of `vertices` (nodes) in the graph.
- $E$ is the set of `edges` (connections) between the vertices.
- $R$ is a relation that maps each edge to a pair of vertices it connects.

The relation associates each edge with two vertices. These vertices of an edge are called the `end points` of the edge.
* A vertex can have multiple edges
* When $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the same, $v_1 = v_2$, $(v_1, v_2)$ is called a `loop`.<br>

## How are graphs traversed?
