## Introduction
This note consists of fundamental definitions of graph theory

## What is a graph?
A graph can be defined using a triple (3-tuple): $def G = (V, E, $a relation of E to V$)$<br>
The relation associates each `edge` with two `vertices`. These vertices of an edge are called the `end points` of the edge.
* A vertex can have multiple edges
* When $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the same, $v_1 = v_2$, $(v_1, v_2)$ is called a `loop`.<br>

## How are graphs traversed?
